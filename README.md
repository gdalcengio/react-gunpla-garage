# Gabe's Gunpla Garage

This is a bigger react project with a mix of one of my hobbies, gundam plastic model building.

## Content

Every gunpla I put on this website is one that I've built in the past. It will be a way to mix my hobbies together and showcase all the work I've put into building these by displaying them as an online storefront.

## Jenkins

Pipeline set up to run jenkins file stage when any branch is pushed.

- Currently broken, plugin configuration UI does not match with documentation

## Testing

I intend to test as I go along, practicing proper 3-layer testing with unit testing, integration testing and end-to-end testing.

- Learned that create-react-app ships with jest
- Can run tests with npm test which is run when branch is pushed
