# react_e_storefront

This project is meant to practice React while exploring appropriate libraries. This will also be a chance for me to explore Jenkins.

## Jenkins

Pipeline set up to run jenkins file stage when any branch is pushed.

- Currently broken, plugin configuration UI does not match with documentation

## Jest

- Learned that create-react-app ships with jest
- Can run tests with npm test which is run when branch is pushed
